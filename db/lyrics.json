ass niggaz is gon' have they hands out\n\nI'm tiiiiired of the drama Ho\nI'm bout to hop my ass off in my hummer Ho\nAnd hit the road like I was car racing\nOn a va-cation, leave 'em all saying\nWhen

on the ground\nCause I'm ballin' like Spalding, shootin' dice like pool\nPlus in up in the club, for free cause I got hooked\n\nI never buy drinks, for bitches\nUnless this bitch my misses\nOr this bitch is my mistress, giving me sexual healing\n\nNo time for love feelings whoa\nDon't tell me y'all alone whoa\nThis here like drug dealings\nGet your kiss out and I'm gone\n\nSeven hiaasen honeys piled up in the Bentley Coup\nChinese chicken heads, fella what you wanna do\nMan I'm tired of all these fake nigga type dudes\nChicks wanna rotate with these eight figga type dudes\n\nI'm a fresh dude, white T and throw back dude\nAll white shoes...blue, yellow, red jewels\nMoney is like steroids, look at my mussels\nAnd if the dance play out, its back to the hustle\nSome say the albums comin' out, it ain't gon sell\nDebut at number one, click!\nWhen you hear the\n\nHello, hello\nThis ya baby boy Tyrese\nHello, hello\nIf you ain't spreading that seed\nHello, hello\nDon't even leave ya

girlfriends, wipe your smile\nSix cars and seven cribs, how y'all like me now?\nI had to turn off the ringer just to hear ya moan\nBut if its ya man, pick up the God damn phone\nWhen you hear
