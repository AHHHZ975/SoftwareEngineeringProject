(Hot Topic!)\n\nHot Topic is a contrived identification with youth subcultures to manufacture an anti-authoritarian identity and make millions. The $8 you paid for the Mudvayne poster would be better spent used to see your brother's friend's band.\n\nDIY ethics are punk rock\nStarting your own label is punk rock\nG.G. Allin was punk rock.\n\nBut when a crass corporate vulture feeds on mass-consumer culture, this spending mommy's money is not punk rock!\n\nWritten by:\nANDREW R.
